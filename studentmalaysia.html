          <p>
            Malaysia is one of the "leading countries for higher education" in
            Asia (Kotera, Ting, & Neary, 2021). This could mean increased
            pressure on students due to the standards of the higher education.
            Analyzing the mental health epidemic among Malaysian students
            involves examining a data set obtained from a survey conducted at
            The International Islamic University of Malaysia (IIUM). IIUM is one
            of the top public universities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia founded in
            1983. To get accepted into this this university, students are
            required to have score of 550 in the Test of English as a Foreign
            Language (TOEFL) or 6.0 points in International English Language
            Testing System (IELTS).

            One hundred students participated in a survey in August 2020 about
            their mental health, reporting if they have anxiety, depression,
            and/or panic attacks. 35 students reported having depression, 34
            reported having anxiety, and 33 reported having panic attacks from
            the data provided.

            Looking further into the data, there are at least two-thirds of the
            students who took the survey reported having at least one mental
            health disorder: depression, anxiety, or panic attacks.

          <p></p>
          <p>
            The cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is a mechanism to evaluate
            a university graduate's knowledge in Malaysia, similar to the GPA
            system in US college systems. Here, CGPA is measured on a 4.00 scale
            as well, with higher CGPA meaning a higher level of academic
            achievement and proficiency in one's courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Figure 3, CGPA was graphed against the number of people who have
            a mental health disorder present. The majority of the surveyed
            college students at IIUM have a CGPA above a 3.00 but also have a
            mental health disorder present. Looking across all the CGPA groups,
            there was at least one participant with a mental health disorder
            present.
          </p>
          <h2>Results and Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            The findings from this survey reveal the mental health challenges
            among students in Mayalsia at the start of the fall semester in
            2020, shortly following the start of the pandemic. Two-thirds of all
            responders reported at least one mental health disorder. One-third
            of students reported having either depression, anxiety, or panic
            attacks. After comparing the CPGA of students to number of students
            with a mental health disorder, it is evident that the majority of
            students have high CGPA and also have a mental health disorder.
          </p>
          <p>
            By analyzing the student experience concerning their mental health
            following the COVID-19 pandemic, valuable insights can be gained
            into how the pandemic affected the mental health of students, even
            in another country. This analysis can contribute to a broader
            understanding of the global implications of the pandemic on student
            well-being, especially after experiencing entirely remote classes
            and isolation from traditional support systems and social networks.
