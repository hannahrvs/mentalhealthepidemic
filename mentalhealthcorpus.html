            The Mental Health Corpus is an extensive collection of writings covering anxiety, depression, 
            and other mental health issues. It has two columns: '1' indicates harmful comments and '0' for comments
            that are not considered harmful. For this dataset, I created a wordcloud
            to represent the most common words that were brought up in the corpus to analyze the 
            language and sentiment surrounding mental health issues.
          </p>
          <h2>Word Cloud of "Harmful" Writings </h2>
          <img
            src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/661227dc767db0efc4310c5b/663996f5d7d1d11ec8bf5121_wordcloud1.png"
            class="main-image"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Figure 1: Word Cloud of most common words from "Harmful" Writing
          </figcaption>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            From figure 1, we see that the most common words are "life", "feel", "know", "even", and "one".
            Looking closer to figure 1, we see some other keywords such as "depression", "death", "want die",
            "hurt", and "sad". These words indicate a focus on emotionally charged topics related to mental health, 
            including feelings of despair, thoughts of self-harm, and emotional pain.
          </p>
          <h2>Word Cloud of "Non-Harmful" Writings </h2>
          <img
            src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/661227dc767db0efc4310c5b/66399ebae461a327c1bc119c_wordcloud0.png"
            class="main-image"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Figure 2: Word Cloud of most common words from "Non-Harmful" Writing
          </figcaption>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Figure 2 shows a word cloud of the most common words are "one", "film", and "movie". These words 
            likely reflect discussions related to entertainment and leisure activities, possibly indicating 
            people sharing quality time with others while watching films or movies. There are more words that 
            give evidence of more positive sentiments, such as "friend", "love", or even "funny". These  
            words indicate feelings of camaraderie, enjoyment, and humor, contributing to an overall 
            positive tone. However, looking more closely, you do see some words with more negative connotations, 
            such as "bad", "hate", or "problem". While these words are less frequent, their presence suggests
            that not all experiences shared within the corpus are entirely positive. They may reflect challenges, 
            conflicts, or negative emotions experienced alongside the positive aspects of life.
