            The Mental Health Corpus (Namdari, 2023) is an extensive collection of writings covering anxiety, depression, 
            and other mental health issues. Each writing is classified as harmful or non-harmful.
            Wordclouds were created to represent the most common words that were brought up in the corpus to analyze the 
            language and sentiment surrounding mental health issues.
          </p>
          <h2>Word Cloud of "Harmful" Writings </h2>
          <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/661227dc767db0efc4310c5b/663996f5d7d1d11ec8bf5121_wordcloud1.png" target="_blank">
            <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/661227dc767db0efc4310c5b/663996f5d7d1d11ec8bf5121_wordcloud1.png" />
          </a>
          <figcaption>
            Figure 1: Word Cloud of most common words from "Harmful" Writing
          </figcaption>
          
          <p></p>
          <p>
            From Figure 1, we see that the most common words are "life", "feel", "know", "even", and "one".
            Looking closer to Figure 1, we see some other keywords such as "depression", "death", "want die",
            "hurt", and "sad". These words indicate a focus on emotionally charged topics related to mental health, 
            including feelings of despair, thoughts of self-harm, and emotional pain.
          </p>
          <h2>Word Cloud of "Non-Harmful" Writings </h2>
          <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/661227dc767db0efc4310c5b/66399ebae461a327c1bc119c_wordcloud0.png" target="_blank">
            <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/661227dc767db0efc4310c5b/66399ebae461a327c1bc119c_wordcloud0.png" />
          </a>
          <figcaption>
            Figure 2: Word Cloud of most common words from "Non-Harmful" Writing
          </figcaption>
          
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Figure 2 shows a word cloud with the most common words of "one", "film", and "movie". These words 
            could possibly reflect discussions related to entertainment and leisure activities, possibly indicating 
            people sharing quality time with others while watching films or movies. There are more words that 
            give evidence of more positive sentiments, such as "friend", "love", or even "funny". These  
            words indicate feelings of friendship, enjoyment, and humor, contributing to an overall 
            positive tone. However, looking more closely, you do see some words with more negative connotations, 
            such as "bad", "hate", or "problem". While these words are less frequent, their presence suggests
            that not all comments classified as "non-harmful" were entirely positive. They may reflect challenges, 
            conflicts, or negative emotions experienced alongside the positive aspects of life.
          </p>
          <h2>Results and Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            Although Figure 1 shows a word cloud of "harmful" writings and Figure 2 shows a word
            cloud of "non-harmful" writings, it is important to analyze both of these as it is crucial 
            to understand the emotional challenges individuals may be facing concerning mental health, whether 
            it is considered harmful or not. It is important to analyze text data in addition to
            numerical data because text data provides a different insight to analyzing mental health 
            disorders among people. These sentiments coming from people with anxiety, depression, and other people
            allows us to guide interventions and support strategies aimed at addressing mental health issues effectively.
